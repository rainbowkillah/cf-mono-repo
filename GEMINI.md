# Directory Overview

This directory serves as a central planning and configuration hub for two upcoming web projects: `mrrainbowsmoke` and `rainbowsmokeofficial.com`. The project is currently in the initial setup and planning phase, with no application code yet implemented.

## Key Files

*   **`AGENTS.md`**: This file outlines the repository guidelines and development conventions that will be followed once coding begins. It covers project structure, build commands, coding style, and testing guidelines.
*   **`plan.md`**: This file is intended for project planning and outlining future development steps. It is currently empty.
*   **`agents.prompt.yml`**: This file is likely intended for configuring prompts for AI agents. It is currently empty.
*   **`mrrainbowsmoke/`**: A directory that will contain the `mrrainbowsmoke` project. It currently only holds a `.env` and `.gitignore` file.
*   **`rainbowsmokeofficial.com/`**: A directory that will contain the `rainbowsmokeofficial.com` project. It currently only holds a `.env` and `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

This directory should be used as the foundation for the development of the two websites. The `AGENTS.md` file should be consulted for development conventions, and the `plan.md` should be updated to reflect the project roadmap. The individual project directories should be populated with source code as development progresses.
