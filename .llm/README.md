# LLM PRIMARY COLLAB SPACE

This directory is the shared workspace for Copilot, Claude, Codex, and Gemini.

## Structure
- `scratchpad.md` — shared working notes, handoffs, and short-term coordination.
- `archive/` — exported chat sessions, context dumps, and session notes.

## Usage Rules
- Keep the scratchpad concise and task-focused.
- Move completed or lengthy notes into `archive/` with a timestamped filename.
- Do not store secrets or .env data.
